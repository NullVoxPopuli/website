I've been a huge fan of ember's progress over the past year and a half, and while I've been riding the canary release train the entire time, enjoying (testing/debugging) features before everyone else does, it's relieving to finally see so many of the features that bring ember into the current state of javascript finally landing. Some may doubt this, but I've been holding back on promoting ember because I believe in the vision of the future (which is nearly now), the vision of Octane, where ember is *just* a thin layer on top of native javascript -- which is immensely important to reducing the learning curve and improving adoptability and searchability. 

This post is inspired by the [call for blog posts to determine the Ember 2019 roadmap](link-tbd) (and [the one from last year](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/05/02/ember-2018-roadmap-call-for-posts.html)) -- while, over the past years I have not worked with ember professionally, I've enjoyed being involved in the community and being involved with the framework as whole as a hobby, there is no greater feeling than taking long breaks from a side project, and knowing exactly where you left off without any catchup/recall cost (I know this is hyperbole.. shhh). However, as I've been trying to stay up to date with the other ecosystems, mainly React, as that's been what I've professionally been doing the past almost three years, I've made note of things that are high on the hype train that I think will allow for ember's adoption to soar.
