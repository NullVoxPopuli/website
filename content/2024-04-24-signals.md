Signals have been [proposed to TC39][signal-proposal] to be built in to JavaScript as a language native feature. 

But what does this actually mean for you and your daily work?

## Who is this for?

<style>
.post-content details {
  align-self: start;

</style>

There are generally three types of roles a person can play when it comes to programming that will be covered in the post -- and these may seem obvious, but it's important that we be on the same page, because it's easy (especially for me!) to forget which audience we're talking about in which situations -- feel free to skip to the next section:

<details><summary>Framework authors</summary>

These are the people who will jump through any hoop in the name of improvement ergonomics, performance, compatibility, you name it. These people work directly on projects like [Angular][angular], [Ember][ember], [Preact][preact], [Solid][solid], [Svelte][svelte], [Vue][vue], and many more.

</details>

<details><summary>Library authors</summary>

These are people who may want their library to be usable in multiple / all frameworks that are supporting Signals -- traditionally in order to have broad reach across every framework, libraries would need to either have no reactivity, or private reactivity (like ), which isn't integrated into the host application, and in either case, if these libraries render anything, the host framework must be hands off, as the library "takes over" the dom element its given and multiple renderers cannot control the same subtree of the DOM -- this is common in [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), or older jQuery based libraries.  Some libraries will provide an abstraction over reactivity and then _adapters_ for each reactivity system -- such as [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)'s React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, and Angular.  

</details>

<details><summary>Application developers</summary>

These people _could_ use the TC39 Signals directly, but more likely that their framework or ecosystem used for their application will provide wrapper utilities that align with the framework/ecosystem's existing nomenclature and mental models. For example, [Svelte has runes](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes), and [Vue has ref](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html), and [Ember has tracked](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/functions/@glimmer%2Ftracking/tracked) -- all of these can _wrap_ the TC39 Signals, and in a _minor, non-breaking, version upgrade_ of your framework's core library, could suddenly have support for Signals and the broader reactive ecosystem -- and you wouldn't even know without reading the changelog! üéâ

## Why am I talking about this?

I, [@NullVoxPopuli][nvp], am _very excited_ about Reactivity.

[nvp]: https://linktr.ee/nullvoxpopuli

There has been a problem in JavaScript since the dawn of time ([1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)): as ecosystems develop (specifically what I am presently concerned about: web apps (which kind of pushes our dawn of time to the mid 2000s)), they cannot share code between each other. React can't share code with Vue, nor can Svelte share code with Vue, or Ember, Angular, Solid, etc.  

_Billions of lines of code have been duplicated across these ecosystems *solely* because the reactive systems are separate_.

There are 3 major categories for which I can place my excitements:

1. **Interopability**, solving the above-described problem
2. **Technically**, the way the reactive algorithm works (even as the TC39 proposal changes over time) is super exciting, and something I've been using myself for years in Ember.
3. **Adoption** - Non-breaking, non-major change to introduce Signal compatibility to a framework.

It's intended for framework and library authors to swap out their internals with the proposal's primitives (shedding tons of kb, and _beginning the **Epic Quest**_ of aligning on all the similarities between our frameworks - eliminating (probably) PBs of network transfer of (basically) duplicate code each year).


## What even are Signals?

Signals are a means to enable efficient computation of state for a particular viewer. The viewer in many cases is the DOM, but could extend to any observable[^observable] boundary, a WebSocket, Database Connection, etc.


The exact way in which this works isn't important right now -- perhaps a topic for another time!


### Some helpful terminology and definitions that various folks use

As people talk about Signals, auto-tracking, Runes, or other forms of reactivity, it may be heplful to have everything defined / so we can all be on the same page / reduce any potential ambiguity or uncertainty.

| term | meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| node | part of the reactive graph |
| value | an alias of node |
| cell | could be an alias of node, but is often root state, part of the spreadsheet analogy |
| root state | a value representing state, it cannot depend on anything within the graph as it is a _root_ |
| atom | an alias of root state |
| derived data | a derivation on or of state(s), which may or may not be cached, in a pure form this could be written as `derived = f(state)` 
| computed | alias of derived, tho this has had different meanings throughout the years in different ecosystems. In this context, specific to [the proposal][signal-proposal], it is a cached derived value.
| formula | alias of derived, part of the spreadsheet analogy
| upstream | the node that is "upstream of" a given node is closer to the root.
| downstream | the node that is "downstream of" a given node is further away from the root.
| sink | a consumer of sources or values
| source | root state, the source of a value
| auto-tracking | the process of automatically tracking if a computed or derived value should recompute next time it is read |
| [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) | work is only performed when needed |
| steady state | re-reading derived values or root state does not cause a change in output
| invalidated | a node in the reactive graph is marked as dirty |
| dirty | a node in the reactive graph will be re-evaluated next time it is read |
| settled | alias of settled state |
| consumed | a derived node has, during evaluation, encountered nodes to depend on
| effect | a "side-effect" running code when something changes -- in practice this has many definitions and semantics |
| entangled | a node in the reactive graph is depends on another node in that same graph, part of the quantum physics analogy
| **push** | when updating a value, the fact of that change is pushed in to all subscribers (sometimes a "renderer", sometimes other nodes of the reactive graph) 
| **pull** | when updating a value, the fact of that change is not realized unless the "renderer" accesses that value.
| Cached | the computation or function will not run again unless the consumed values within change
| Runes | What Svelte calls their Signals
| Tracked properties | What Ember calls their Signals
| refs | What Vue calls their reactive values

Continue the quantum physics analogy:

> A signal graph is in a superposition of states, but you can't tell because the second you try to observe them the wave collapses
>
> but you can create double slit experiments

## Why should I care?

From [gbj in the Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1224208557126193333/1226244045689327769/1227374931168464957)
> the proposal is designed to be the greatest common factor of the existing mainstream framework signal approaches, not the least common denominator

> It‚Äôs ‚Äúhow much could we share?‚Äù not ‚Äúhow little can we get away with?‚Äù


Imagine, 

## What are the requirements?

- [Autotracking](https://github.com/proposal-signals/proposal-signals/issues/161) - the main feature of the Signals proposal that makes it more than just values and functions
- Memory allocations should be kept to a minimum
- `Signal.State` should be sub-classable so that frameworks can add their own functionality on top
- multiple types of effects and batching should be implementable by framework authors

## What are the considerations?

- The proposal is minimal, and intended to be added on to later -- Changes to a language take a lot of time, so like a pull request, the smaller it is, the higher the chance it will progress towards being accepted


## Seems like there are missing features ü§î

The proposal, at the time of writing, is still in stage 0, so just about everything is subject to change and nothing is set in stone. 

### effects

Since the proposal's submission to TC39, one of the most commonly requested features is an "effect" primitive. There are a few different reasons that folks cite as needing effects, but we'll get to that in a bit -- first, we need to understand why effects were left out of the proposal.  

> _How much could we share?_

The initial implementation of the Signals proposal includes a [`Watcher`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals?tab=readme-ov-file#implementing-effects) API, which allows framework authors to choose their own timing semantincs, batching, or phase to run all the effects. In situations where rendering is how effects are used, rendering can be expensive (imagine updating 10,000 or more DOM nodes), and you may want to some sort of [scheduler](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/957/) that optimizes how the rendering happens or gives the reactive graph a chance to settle to reduce rendering attempts. 

How this exactly happens is slightly different between ecah framework ecosystem, so effects can't be implemented as a core feature (for all frameworks to use) because frameworks have different semantics for when the effect actually runs.

_But_, after some discussions with early experimenters and reviewers of the proposal, there are many kinds of effects. The different kinds of effects depend on timing, semantics, and batching.

Todo: rephrase:

I think you want to make a stronger claim here: there's no way to write a "scheduler" for effects that would integrate as well as framework validations along the framework's own dynamic tree

I usually use the example of not doing something because the parent was removed

Todo: rephrase, add example 

which is that if you think about it for 30s it becomes apparent that the "minimal" abstraction lives in DOM and integrates with DOM scheduling

For example (TODO: validate this with links):

 "createEffect creates a new computation that runs the given function in a tracking scope, thus automatically tracking its dependencies, and automatically reruns the function whenever the dependencies update"
[9:07 PM]
"whenever the dependencies update"
[9:07 PM]
The effect will run whenever a changes value.
 (edited)
[9:08 PM]
The first execution of the effect function is not immediate; it's scheduled to run after the current rendering phase (e.g., after calling the function passed to render, createRoot, or runWithOwner). If you want to wait for the first execution to occur, use queueMicrotask (which runs before the browser renders the DOM) or await Promise.resolve() or setTimeout(..., 0) (which runs after browser rendering).
[9:08 PM]
[9:08 PM]
a clue! https://docs.solidjs.com/reference/reactive-utilities/create-root
[9:09 PM]

exception: Solid has types of effects, and one such effect is a syrchronous effect that has a specific situation -- TODO: write what this is.

#### a tiny abstraction

An effect would be implemented like this:
```js
function effect(fn) {
  // watch

  return {
    [Symbol.dispose]() {
      // unwatch
    }
  }
}
```
and then in your component you'd do something like this:
```js
function Demo() {
  using effect(() => { ... });
    // ...
}
```

## How this affects you

### library authoring

Here is a demo of [Signals in React and Svelte by Jack Herrington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSVcZa5yTKE&pp=ygUPamFjayBoZXJyaW5ndG9u) -- showing that we can make cross-framework libraries.

- reactive code using what's in the proposal
- no need for abstractions
- must subscribe to "derived" purism (no effects), or implement a [`using`][using-proposal] / Resource-based effect as a util in your library, but I wouldn't recommend this.

In universal code, we can't use effects, because an effect usually has framework-specific semantics that don't make sense in toher frameworks -- for example, if you use React's effect, the whole library may as well be react-specific.

- you can use impure computeds, like the [`asyncFunction`](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/signal-utils/?tab=readme-ov-file#async-function) [implemention](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/signal-utils/blob/main/src/async-function.ts) does:
```js
const state = new State(fn);
const computed = new Signal.Computed(() => {
  state.retry(); // side-effecting!

  return state;
});
```

example usage:
```js
import { Signal } from 'signal-polyfill';
import { signalFunction } from 'signal-utils/async-function';

const url = new Signal.State('...');
const signalResponse = signalFunction(async () => {
  const response = await fetch(url.get()); // entangles with `url`
  // after an away, you've detatched from the signal-auto-tracking
  return response.json(); 
});

// output: true
// after the fetch finishes
// output: false
<template>
  <output>{{signalResponse.isLoading}}</output>
</template>
```
