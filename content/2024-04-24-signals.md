Signals have been [proposed to TC39][signal-proposal] to be built in to JavaScript as a language native feature. 

But what does this actually mean for you and your daily work?

There are generally three types of roles a person can play when it comes to programming -- and these may seem obvious, but it's important that we be on the same page, because it's easy (especially for me!) to forget which audience we're talking about in which situations -- feel free to skip to the next section:

**Framework authors**

These are the people who will jump through any hoop in the name of ergonomics, performance, compatibility, you name it. These people work directly on projects like [Angular][angular], [Ember][ember], [Preact][preact], [Solid][solid], [Svelte][svelte], [Vue][vue], and many more.

**Library authors**

These are people who may want their library to be usable in multiple / all frameworks that are supporting Signals -- traditionally in order to have broad reach across every framework, libraries would need to either have no reactivity, or private reactivity -- which isn't integrated into the host application, and in either case, if these libraries render anything, the host framework must be hands off, as the library "takes over" the dom element that it is given and _multiple renderers cannot control the same subtree of the DOM_ -- this is common in [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), or older jQuery based libraries.  Some libraries will provide an abstraction over reactivity and then _adapters_ for each reactivity system -- such as [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)'s React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, and Angular.  


**Application developers**

These people _could_ use the TC39 Signals directly, but more likely that their framework or ecosystem used for their application will provide wrapper utilities that align with the framework/ecosystem's existing nomenclature and mental models. For example, [Svelte has runes](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes), and [Vue has ref](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html), and [Ember has tracked](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/functions/@glimmer%2Ftracking/tracked) -- all of these can _wrap_ the TC39 Signals, and in a _minor, non-breaking, version upgrade_ of your framework's core library, could suddenly have support for Signals and the broader reactive ecosystem -- and you wouldn't even know without reading the changelog! üéâ

## Why am I talking about this?

I, [@NullVoxPopuli][nvp], am _very excited_ about Reactivity[^my-writing].

[nvp]: https://linktr.ee/nullvoxpopuli

There has been a problem in JavaScript since the dawn of time ([1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)): as ecosystems develop (and specifically what I am presently concerned about: web apps (which, kind of, moves our dawn of time to the mid 2000s)), they cannot share code between each other. React can't share code with Vue, nor can Svelte share code with Vue, or Ember, Angular, Solid, etc.  

_Billions of lines of code have been duplicated across these ecosystems *solely*[^solely-duplication] because the reactive systems are separate_.

There are 3 major categories for which I can place my excitements:

1. **Interopability**, solving the above-described problem
2. **Technically**, the way the reactive algorithm works (even as the TC39 proposal changes over time) is super exciting, and something I've been using myself for years in Ember.
3. **Adoption** - Non-breaking, non-major change[^editions] to introduce Signal compatibility to a framework. 

It's intended for framework and library authors to swap out their internals with the proposal's primitives (shedding tons of kb, and _beginning the **Epic Quest**_ of aligning on all the similarities between our frameworks - eliminating (probably) [Petabytes](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petabyte) of network transfer of (basically) duplicate code each year).


## What even are Signals?

Signals are a means to enable efficient computation of state for a particular viewer. The viewer in many cases is the DOM, but could extend to any observable[^observable] boundary, a WebSocket, Database Connection, etc.


The exact way in which this works isn't important right now (and also the exact details will probably change over time as the proposal is still in [Stage 0](https://tc39.es/process-document/)) -- perhaps a topic for another time!


### Some helpful terminology and definitions that various folks use

As people talk about Signals, auto-tracking, Runes, or other forms of reactivity, it may be heplful to have everything defined / so we can all be on the same page / reduce any potential ambiguity or uncertainty. Not all of these will be used here, in this post, but... more _for your (and my own) information[^terms]_.

| term | meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| node | part of the reactive graph |
| value | an alias of node |
| cell | could be an alias of node, but is often root state, part of the spreadsheet analogy |
| root state | a value representing state, it cannot depend on anything within the graph as it is a _root_ |
| atom | an alias of root state |
| derived data | a derivation on or of state(s), which may or may not be cached, in a pure form this could be written as `derived = f(state)` 
| computed | alias of derived, tho this has had different meanings throughout the years in different ecosystems. In this context, specific to [the proposal][signal-proposal], it is a cached derived value.
| formula | alias of derived, part of the spreadsheet analogy
| upstream | the node that is "upstream of" a given node is closer to the root.
| downstream | the node that is "downstream of" a given node is further away from the root.
| sink | a consumer of sources or values
| source | root state, the source of a value
| auto-tracking | the process of automatically tracking if a computed or derived value should recompute next time it is read |
| [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) | work is only performed when needed |
| steady state | re-reading derived values or root state does not cause a change in output
| invalidated | a node in the reactive graph is marked as dirty |
| dirty | a node in the reactive graph will be re-evaluated next time it is read |
| settled | alias of settled state |
| consumed | a derived node has, during evaluation, encountered nodes to depend on
| effect | a "side-effect" running code when something changes -- in practice this has many definitions and semantics |
| entangled | a node in the reactive graph is depends on another node in that same graph, part of the quantum physics analogy
| **push** | when updating a value, the fact of that change is pushed in to all subscribers (sometimes a "renderer", sometimes other nodes of the reactive graph) 
| **pull** | when updating a value, the fact of that change is not realized unless the "renderer" accesses that value.
| Cached | the computation or function will not run again unless the consumed values within change
| Runes | What Svelte calls their Signals
| Tracked properties | What Ember calls their Signals
| refs | What Vue calls their reactive values

To continue the quantum physics analogy:

> A signal graph is in a superposition of states, but you can't tell because the second you try to observe them the wave collapses
>
> but you can create double slit experiments.

## Why should I care?

From [gbj in the Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1224208557126193333/1226244045689327769/1227374931168464957)

Imagine, a reactive library could be built in a such a way, using native Signals, that it works across UI Frameworks: Vue, Svete, Ember, (etc), Node CLI applications, databases, websocket implementations, etc. This proposal has the opportunity to dramatically reduce the amount of duplicate code we have between our different JavaScript ecosystems.

Some libraries that I think could greatly benefit from a shared signal implementation (provided target frameworks also natively integrate with native signals):
- [TanStack](https://tanstack.com/) family of projects.
- Charting libraries, such as [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
- Any project using web components.


I don't have data, as this would be very hard to measure, but I like guessing, so _I'm guessing_: if we had standard / platform / native signals 6 years ago, we could have saved at least a trillion dollars in duplicate library development consts, research and development, etc. Now, none of this proposal would be possible without those 6+ years of research, exploration, collaboration, and trying to out-do one another üòâ.


One thing that will be interesting longer term is how [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) could maybe one day be ergonomic to author without the use of a wrapper library ([Lit](https://lit.dev/), for example (which fixes some of web components' ergonomics)).

There are two places to watch for developments there:
- [HTML Template Instantiation](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Template-Instantiation.md)
- [DOM Parts](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/pull/1023)

## What are the requirements?

- [Autotracking](https://github.com/proposal-signals/proposal-signals/issues/161) - the main feature of the Signals proposal that makes it more than just values and functions.
- Memory allocations should be kept to a minimum.
- `Signal.State` should be sub-classable so that frameworks can add their own functionality on top.
- multiple types of effects and batching should be implementable by framework authors.
- Writes are synchronous, and immediately take effect. At no point in the reactive graph would reading a descendent, deriving from some ancestor, be out of sync.

## What are the considerations?

This is just a snippet of a much bigger list of goals, considerations, and desires for the Signals proposal:

- The proposal is minimal, and intended to be added on to later -- Changes to a language take a lot of time, so like a pull request, the smaller it is, the higher the chance it will progress towards being accepted.  
- Computation must be glitch-free, so no unnessary calculations are ever performed.
- JS Frameworks have their own scheduling, and the native signals implementation should enable that. There is likely no way to write a "scheduler" that efficiently integrates with a framework's own dynamic tree better than the framework native scheduling.
- Enable composition of different codebases which use Signals -- aka / cross-framework library sharing.

There are many more of these, and if you want to learn more about this, check out the [Design goals for Signals](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals?tab=readme-ov-file#design-goals-for-signals).

## Seems like there are missing features ü§î

The proposal, at the time of writing, is still in [Stage 0](https://tc39.es/process-document/), so just about everything is subject to change and nothing is set in stone.  

If you want to help out with the proposal, please [open an issue or PR for collaboration][signal-proposal] üéâ

### effects

Since the proposal's submission to TC39, one of the most commonly requested features is an "effect" primitive. There are a few different reasons that folks cite for needing effects, but we'll get to that in a bit -- first, we need to understand why effects were left out of the proposal.  

> _How much could we share?_

The initial implementation of the Signals proposal includes a [`Watcher`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals?tab=readme-ov-file#implementing-effects) API, which allows framework authors to choose their own timing semantincs, batching, or phase, to run all the effects. In situations where rendering is how effects are used, rendering can be expensive (imagine updating 10,000 or more DOM nodes), and you may want to some sort of [scheduler](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/957/) that optimizes how the rendering happens or gives the reactive graph a chance to settle to reduce rendering attempts (i.e.: it's wasteful to render faster than a monitor's refresh rate but also, if the reactive graph hasn't stabilized, you don't want to render glitches -- there is a correlation to video games here where games can have adaptive refresh rates to reduce jitter and screen tearing that result in smoother visuals, rather than trying to force a new image every frame of the monitor's default frame rate). 

How this exactly happens is slightly different between each framework ecosystem, so effects can't be implemented as a core feature (for all frameworks to use) because frameworks have different semantics for when the effect actually runs.

Additionally, the `Watcher` implementation requires "unsubscribing", like you would with a [`ResizeObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver) or [`MutationObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) or [`add/remove eventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener). And in order to safely unsubscribe, you either need an ownership implementation (e.g.: when a parent "container" is destroyed, you would also also destroy / clean up / unsubscribe from all child things). 

_But_, after some discussions with early reviewers of the proposal, some folks are perfectly fine with managing cleanup themselves -- it's something that developers would be used to if they aren't using a framework which reduces the need to think about cleanup altogether. After all, UI _frameworks_ are not the only audience for the Signals proposal, and there are a lot of cool projects brewing out there using reactive programming outside of UI frameworks. 

**There are many kinds of effects**. The different kinds of effects depend on timing, semantics, and batching. Here is a table of the types of effects as I can remember them at the moment:

| | Synchronizing External State | Synchronizing Internal State | Immediate-Read |
| --- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Synchronous Effects |   |  ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ |
| Scheduled Effects | ‚úÖ | | | 
| Lifecycle Effects | ‚úÖ | üò¨ | |

There are three categories here:
- Synchronizing External State: Updating state outside of your program, such as the URL, another library, a storage, etc -- state that is not usually reactive.
- Synchronizing Internal State: Updating state within your program, this state would already be reactive. 
- Immediate-Read: See the example below under `_Synchronous Effect_`


As a bit of an aside, I think we need more names for these sorts of things. Between the overloaded functionality/semantics here, with effects, and the vastly different audiences that will be interacting with Signals, and the proposal in general, I think more specific names (or multi-word names?) would help a ton in terms of clarity and communicating intent.

**What's a Scheduled or Lifecycle Effect?**

These are most of the types of effects that folks have used in their daily life. Not all, but most frameworks have timing semantics to their effects which integrate nicely with some rendering scheduler to help batch changes to flush to a UI. For example, React has 3 kinds of userland effects: [useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect), [useLayoutEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useLayoutEffect), and [useInsertionEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useInsertionEffect).

**What's a _Synchronous Effect_?**

These were new to me, as I began exploring how different ecosystems think about reactivity -- here is the gist as code:
```js
const a = new Signal.State(0);
const b = new Signal.State(0);

syncEffect(() => a.set(b.get()));

a.get(); // 0;
b.set(1);
a.get(); // 1
```

In contrast with Scheduled or Lifecycle Effects, the following behavior would be observed -- values are not immediately available:
```js
const a = new Signal.State(0);
const b = new Signal.State(0);

createEffect(() => a.set(b.get()));

a.get(); // 0;
b.set(1);
a.get(); // 0
await /* a tiny bit of time, microtask, animation frame, etc */ 
a.get(); // 1
```

As with all effects, we risk introduce ["spooky action at a distance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance_(computer_programming)), but the gist is that this type of (synchronous) effect maintains Glitch-free behavior by running immediatly after consumed signals within the effect are written to. 

In a more real use case, they can be used to implement the `localCopy` pattern for forking state locally until the remote value updates, at which point the "local copy" is re-set back to the value of the remote. Here are examples using effects in [Preact (using useRef, useEffect, effect)](https://preactjs.com/repl?code=aW1wb3J0IHsgcmVuZGVyIH0gZnJvbSAncHJlYWN0JzsKaW1wb3J0IHsgdXNlUmVmLCB1c2VFZmZlY3QgfSBmcm9tICdwcmVhY3QvaG9va3MnOwppbXBvcnQgeyBzaWduYWwsIGVmZmVjdCwgdXNlU2lnbmFsIH0gZnJvbSAnQHByZWFjdC9zaWduYWxzJzsKaW1wb3J0IHsgaHRtbCB9IGZyb20gJ2h0bS9wcmVhY3QnOwoKZnVuY3Rpb24gdXNlTG9jYWxDb3B5KHJlbW90ZSkgewoJY29uc3QgbG9jYWwgPSB1c2VSZWYoKTsKCWlmICghbG9jYWwuY3VycmVudCkgewoJCWxvY2FsLmN1cnJlbnQgPSBzaWduYWwocmVtb3RlLnBlZWsoKSk7Cgl9CgoJdXNlRWZmZWN0KCgpID0%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%2BIHsKICAgICAgICBzdWJtaXRFdmVudC5wcmV2ZW50RGVmYXVsdCgpOwogICAgICAgIG9uU3VibWl0KHsgdmFsdWU6IGxvY2FsTmFtZS52YWx1ZSB9KTsKICAgIH0KCiAgICByZXR1cm4gaHRtbGAKICAgICAgICA8Zm9ybSBvblN1Ym1pdD0ke2hhbmRsZVN1Ym1pdH0%2BCiAgICAgICAgICAgIDxsYWJlbD4KICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgIEVkaXQgTmFtZTogICAKICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgIDxpbnB1dCB2YWx1ZT0ke2xvY2FsTmFtZS52YWx1ZX0gb25JbnB1dD0ke3VwZGF0ZUxvY2FsTmFtZX0gLz4KICAgICAgICAgICAgPC9sYWJlbD4KCiAgICAgICAgICAgIDxidXR0b24%2BU3VibWl0PC9idXR0b24%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%2BQ2F1c2UgRXh0ZXJuYWwgQ2hhbmdlPC9idXR0b24%2BCgogICAgICAgIDxociAvPgogICAgICAgIExhc3QgU3VibWl0dGVkOjxiciAvPgogICAgICAgIDxwcmU%2BJHtKU09OLnN0cmluZ2lmeShkYXRhLnZhbHVlLCBudWxsLCAzKX08L3ByZT5gOwp9CgpyZW5kZXIoPEFwcCAvPiwgZG9jdW1lbnQuZ2V0RWxlbWVudEJ5SWQoJ2FwcCcpKTsK) and [Solid (using createMemo + untrack)](https://playground.solidjs.com/anonymous/0cf7972e-f55d-4483-909d-6c172c80d5ac).
But what's interesting about this specific use case is that _you don't need an effect_ to achieve the same behavior.

-------

_It is human nature to think in terms of cause and effect_, but in programming, we often benefit from not thinking like humans. 

----

I know a lot of folks are used to thinking in effects in programming, so the fact that the signals proposal doesn't have effects as a primitive has been quite jarring, and frustrating for many. 
In general, though, (and I went through this journey myself, going from React for many years into the Ember ecosystem), I'd like to encourage folks to try, even if just for mental exercise or experimentation, to not use effects.

For example, back in my React days, I'd see a lot of running async functions using effects (I even did this when I was first learning hooks!) -- but it's not needed. We can use an "impure" computed, which invokes an async function gives us a reactive state back to inspect the lifecycle states of the returned Promise. In [signal-utils' `signalFunction`](https://github.com/proposal-signals/signal-utils/blob/main/src/async-function.ts),
```ts
export function signalFunction<Return>(fn: () => Return): State<Return> {
  const state = new State(fn);
  const computed = new Signal.Computed(() => {
    state.retry();

    return state;
  });

  /**
   * We have to use a proxy here so that we re-get on each property acess.
   * this allows the consumers of this signalFunction to not have to bother with
   * signal APIs, and just worry about dealing with our `State` API.
   *
   * If any signal data is consumed in the passed `fn` before the first await, 
   * (before the first microtask queue schedule)
   * changes to that signal data will cause `state.retry()` to get called again,
   * giving us a new request with new pending / error status, etc.
   */
  return new Proxy(state, {
    get(_, property, receiver) {
      computed.get();
      return Reflect.get(state, property, receiver);
    },
  });
}
```

This call to `state.retry()` is a side-effect, (and further, why we need more names for these behaviors), but it is consistently re-invoked any time signals in `fn` change.

A userland example of usage of the above utility:
```js
const idSignal = new Signal.State(1);

const asyncState = signalFunction(async () => {
  let id = idSignal.get();

  // anything beyond here is not entangled with the `asyncState`
  await // ...
});
```

Some folks may want automatic cleanup, such as via [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController), but automatic integration of that requires implementing an ownership and lifetime system.

#### scheduling

One thing I'd like to see explored, for UI frameworks (be that the in a browser, or in a terminal), is a [Render-Aware Scheduler][rfc-render-aware] (by [@runspired][runspired]).

![Frame overview](/images/rfc-0957-frame-overview.svg)

I don't know if this design (there is [sample code in the RFC][rfc-render-aware]) has enough granularity and flexibility for all frameworks to use, but it would, imo, be the next step in figuring out what can be shared across frameworks.
Once there is a scheduler, we could have a consistent effect (or set of effects) with consistent timing semantics.
_And then_, we could maybe start exploring a shared ownership model! Which could mean that destruction and _most_ code across all frameworks that wasn't product or framework-api-specific could be shared. 

If / when that happens, then there would no longer be a need for [Starbeam](https://github.com/starbeamjs/starbeam)[^starbeam-note] (or similar projects) -- assuming that the reactive primitives we have at that point between frameworks agree with each other -- one of Starbeam's goals is to provide the same timing semantics across all frameworks and unify the behavior of higher-level reactive primitives -- it provides predictable behavior with Externally syncing state (`Sync`), functions with lifetime and cleanup (`Resource`), element modifiers, services, etc.

---------------------------------------

All this isn't to say I don't think effects should ever be in the proposal -- but it will be _difficult_. [signal-utils][signal-utils] provides an effect that you have to unwatch yourself, and that has proven useful for my own [JSBin demos][jsbin-signal].

In summary, outside of application development, here are places where effects are _needed_ 
- DOM rendering (frameworks implement these)
- WebGL / Canvas / Game rendering 
-  

## How this affects you

### library authoring

Here is a demo of [Signals in React and Svelte by Jack Herrington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSVcZa5yTKE&pp=ygUPamFjayBoZXJyaW5ndG9u) -- showing that we can make cross-framework libraries.

- reactive code using what's in the proposal
- no need for abstractions
- must subscribe to "derived" purism (no effects).

In universal code, we can't use effects, because an effect usually has framework-specific semantics that don't make sense in toher frameworks -- for example, if you use React's effect, the whole library may as well be react-specific.
As a library author, you could circumvent this restriction by requiring your users to call a destructor at time that makes sense for your library, which calls the `Watcher`'s `unwatch` method.

- you can use impure computeds, like the [`asyncFunction`](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/signal-utils/?tab=readme-ov-file#async-function) [implemention](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/signal-utils/blob/main/src/async-function.ts) does (mentioned above).

example usage:
```jsx
import { Signal } from 'signal-polyfill';
import { signalFunction } from 'signal-utils/async-function';

const url = new Signal.State('...');
const signalResponse = signalFunction(async () => {
  const response = await fetch(url.get()); // entangles with `url`
  // after an away, you've detatched from the signal-auto-tracking
  return response.json(); 
});

// output: true
// after the fetch finishes
// output: false
<template>
  <output>{{signalResponse.isLoading}}</output>
</template>
```


For now, there is an exploratory [signal-utils][signal-utils] library with a bunch of reactive utilities and data structures -- pull requests are very encouraged here, but it'd be awesome to see other experiments people come up in their own libraries! (Noting that we don't want to accidentally make a new framework, but moreso want to test out the capabilities of the polyfill / current design of the proposal and validate ergonomics / problems / etc).

### framework maintenance

The dream is that once frameworks integrate with native signals, whole ecosystems begin to start being able to share resources with one another. 

Especially as it is still the early days, the most useful thing now with respect to the proposal is to try out the polyfill in your framework, replacing your own reactive primitives with those from the [polyfill][signal-polyfill] and open issues such as:
- [Batch unsubscribe issue](https://github.com/proposal-signals/signal-polyfill/issues/2)
- [calling watch on computed signal can prevent getting correct latest value](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals/issues/216)
- [False positive in cycle detection](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals/issues/201)
- and more!! folks are already doing a great job testing things out!

Here is an example of [@lifeart](https://github.com/lifeart)'s spike to add the signal polyfill to their renderer[^glimmer-next]: [glimmer-next#114](https://github.com/lifeart/glimmer-next/pull/114), and in doing so, a problem was found where [`unwatch` performance worsened by ~ 3000%](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals/issues/215) (oops).


Effects and fine-grained rendering can be implemented via a watched `Computed` like here in [glimmer-next](https://github.com/lifeart/glimmer-next/pull/114/files#diff-15c9f7b9618cbbf23b072333b9f93d40bbc409eb188ef9be0adc3674803b7f18L95) -- this whole PR is probably a good reference for the amount of work involved in swapping the core reactive primitives. 

Higher level abstractions should also be possible, and some of these are explored in [signal-utils][signal-utils]. For example, in ecosysetms that encourage classes, they may implement a decorator which allows "just regular property access" to continue working:
```jsx
import { signal } from 'signal-utils';

class State {
    @signal accessor #value = 3;

    get doubled() {
        return this.#value * 2;
    }

    increment = () => this.#value++;
}

let state = new State();


// output: 6
// button clicked
// output: 8
<template>
  <output>{{state.doubled}}</output>
  <button onclick={{state.increment}}>+</button>
</template>
```

Another example, for reference, could be the [`reaction()`](https://github.com/proposal-signals/signal-utils/pull/61) utility from [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/reactions.html#reaction).



### application dev

For now there isn't much to do _directly_ with the proposal, but you can work with your framework ecosystems to see how you can help test things out and proide feedback! 
This isn't to say that you wouldn't be able to use native Signals in your application once everything ships, and is integrated, etc, but moreso that you'll _likely_ want to stick with your framework's specific nomenclature, utilities, etc.


## How you can get involved

On [this call for participation](https://github.com/proposal-signals/proposal-signals/issues/96) on the [proposal github][signal-proposal], you'll find links to 
- [The Signals Discord Server][signal-discord]
- [Asking for help, and ways you can help](https://github.com/proposal-signals/proposal-signals/issues/95)

In summary, many / most contributions are welcome:
- fixing typos in the README
- adding tests
- playing with the polyfill (finding bugs, fixing them, etc)
- Document use cases for or against certain reactive programming patterns (and if the current design supports those use cases)

and more! (see the [linked issue](https://github.com/proposal-signals/proposal-signals/issues/95))

You can also try out signals for yourself here at this [JSBin][jsbin-signal].

There is a lot to do!, but we'll get there! Between finding alignment with the broadest group possible, time to implement and adopt, and then adding additional proposals that build on top of the Signals proposal, this is my favorite meme:

[^observable]: this definition of observable is simply "noticeable" / "to be noticed" and in no way is intended to correlate to the the programming concept by the same name. Observables as a pattern (rx.js) _invert_ the reactive graph from Signals, and have proven to be less efficient. They are a useful tool!, just not for _everything_ ([Angular](https://angular.io/guide/signals) has been [moving](https://dev.to/mfp22/signals-make-angular-much-easier-3k9) to [Signals](https://medium.com/@michaelfrontend/angular-signals-vs-rxjs-navigating-the-reactive-programming-landscape-946c6dbe79d8) from [rx.js](https://rxjs.dev/), for example).

[^my-writing]: But I haven't been the best at communicating -- written, spoken, or otherwise -- about my excitement for reactivity -- a lot of concepts are quite abstract, and a hard to find the right balance of distilling a problem to something digestible verses finding something complex enough where people don't immediately fall in to "but this other way is much easier, or could be done like 'this'".


[^solely-duplication]: maybe not _solely_, exactly. I'm sure there is a good amount of "I could do better" and "There are bugs, how hard could it be[^how-hard-could-it-be] to do myself"? 

[^how-hard-could-it-be]: Anyone else have this genetic trait where they generously undeestimate effort of a task? (not just in programming) .

[^editions]: See also: [Editions](https://emberjs.com/editions/), an extension to [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

[^terms]: This table alone, with examples in the wild could / should probably be its own post -- it's a lot of information.

[^glimmer-next]: this is an alternate DOM renderer for Ember focused on performance, and trying to incrementally gain as much compatibility as possible where it makes sense. I've opened an issue on Ember for a [Swappable Renderer](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/20648) to help explore what this could be capable of, what compatibility is missing, etc -- it's still early, and the ideas still need to be proved out in big projects. 


[^starbeam-note]: Starbeam is not 1.0 yet, and does not presently have a production ready release, so folks should hold off on trying it out. The docs even mismatch a little at this point, so learning it would be a smidge confusing without diving in to the code as the source-of-truth for learning.
