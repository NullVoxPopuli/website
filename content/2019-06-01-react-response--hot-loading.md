# React Response: Setting up Hot Module Replacement

Partially due to the fact that I find coming up with things to write about somewhat difficult, I've been seeking articles from the React community to rewrite for Ember (primarily [on twitter](https://twitter.com/nullvoxpopuli/status/1134602455088619521)). This'll help the searchability of common patterns people may be familiar with when coming from React, or any other ecosystem which also has a similar nomenclature.

My hope for this series is only two things:
 - Improve the perception of Ember with respect to modern features and behavior
 - Show how conventions and Plugin Architecture can make everyone's lives easier.
