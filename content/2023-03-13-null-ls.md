For a long time, I'd been hearing about [null_ls](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim) on the [neovim subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/) and how it solves all my non-language-server tooling problems. 

I had given a brief look at `null_ls` a while back, and didn't really comprehend what it wanted of me. I didn't understand how _my_ neovim config applied, and how _I_ setup my language servers would be applicable or not.

It wasn't until _yesterday_ when I was playing around with custom `root_dir` functions on `tsserver` and `glint` language server. 


Normal language servers are set up by requiring `lspconfig` and calling the appropriate server's setup method:
```lua 
local lsp = require('lspconfig')

lsp[serverName].setup({   
  -- config here
})
```

and `null_ls` is similar:
```lua 
local null_ls = require('null-ls')

null_ls.setup({
 -- config here
})
```

and that's the whole gist ðŸŽ‰.

Of course, just being able to call `setup` isn't enough, I wanted the following features:
- eslint 
  - diagnostics and code-actions 
  - run on save
- prettier 
  - diagnostics and code-actions 
  - run on save
- spell check diagnostics and actions 
  - a single machine-global file to store my custom words
  - I had lost this when I switched away from [CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)

It turns out that all of these integrations are built-in to `null_ls`!!

As I was browsing for which built-in configs would work best for me, I learned that both prettier and eslint have _daemon_ versions, [`eslint_d`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint_d) and [`prettierd`](https://github.com/fsouza/prettierd). This is important to me because I want my editor to be as fast and as responsive as possible, and in order to accomplish that with `node`'s boot time, daemonizing just makes sense to help out with time and memory and _block_ the main thread for the least amount of time possible while performing "format on save". Both README's for these two tools explain the philosophy behind their approaches.

To make `null_ls` as obvious and as isolated as possible, I did all configuration in a separate file that I require from my main lsp-config lua file.

To set up all `null_ls` stuff, I do this "somewhere":
```lua 
require('plugin-config.lsp.integrations')
```
where I have a `plugin-config/lsp/integrations.lua` file where all the `null_ls` code lives.



## The Code / config

In my file where I configure what plugins I want, I have this:
```lua 
use {
  'jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim',
  requires = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" }
}
```

I use [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) for package management.

The [official docs](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim/blob/main/doc/CONFIG.md) are really good, and I really just needed to have read them.

Then my `plugin-config/lsp/integration.lua` file has these contents, below -- this is the combination of a bunch of docs, example code, and other people's solution to problems. I'll explain in comments in the snippet in case things may not be clear.
