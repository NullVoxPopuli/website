I've been interested in Artificial Intelligence for many many decades but with the mass adoption of LLMs, it has become increasingly important to help with discerning the difference between human and AI, since LLMs are being used to pump out vast amounts of low quality blogs, videos, art, etc.  AI can be used for good, learning, etc, and I look forward to seeing what it can do in the future.

This blog, all posts on it, all content, etc, are written by me, and not by AI. I have no reason to farm content. The purpose of this blog is to record my thoughts on tech, software, programming, etc.
